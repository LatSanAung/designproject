<p>&nbsp;" ENJOY TO FLY MORE "</p>
<h2>Logo Rationale</h2>
<p>A distinct mythology revolves around the legendary Hintha Bird Widely depicted in Myanmar's arts‚ the mystical bird has special meaning in monastic philosophy‚ in that it is unsoiled by the illusory nature of the material world.</p>
<p>The Hintha bird also represents perfect union‚ balance and life. It transcends the limitations of the world surrounding it‚ as it can walk on the earth‚ fly in the sky and swim in the water.</p>
<p>The mystique surrounding the Hintha bird markes it the perfect logo of Airlines‚ which combines modern design with the tradition and spirit of Myanmar. The elegant‚ highly stylized Hintha icon reflects the dynamism of the airline and Myanmar's aviation industry.</p>
<p>The word " Golden " is also prominently featured in the logo‚ representing the signature brand of the airline. The additional stroke of colour around the Hintha bird signifies a graceful flight towards a new horizon.</p>
<p>The main colour of the icon is‚ of course‚ gold‚ representing success‚ achievement and prestige.</p>
